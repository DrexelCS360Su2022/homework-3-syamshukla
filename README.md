Please let us know how much time you spent on each problem. You may enter time using any format described [here](https://github.com/wroberts/pytimeparse).

Problem 1: 20m

Took some time to get the error to work correctly. Other primitiave operations were simple to implement.

Problem 2: 40m

Didn't fully understand how to implement and/or as a special form until rereading the special form documentation.
I was not able to get the and statement to work with an arrangement of different input types such as a string, a list of numbers and single number.

Problem 3: 1h

I was able to get let to work shortly after I was able to get the and/or to work. I got the main clarificaiton after rewatching lecture 2 part 2 which helped me reach my solution.

Problem 4: 3h
